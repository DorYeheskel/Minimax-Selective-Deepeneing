To reprocude the experiments:
-----------------------------
*) General:
- Use Linux os and clone this project.
- Each of the runs should be done from the main directory.

1) Time experiments:
    - Enter to the main directory.
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/test_time.sh &
    - Results should be print to terminal.
    - Copy the results and create the csv file "./experiments/results/time_results.csv".
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/print_graphs.py
    - Graph should be printed.

2) Params experiments:
    - Enter to the main directory.
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/test_params.sh &
    - Results should be print to terminal.
    - Copy the results and create the csv file "./experiments/results/params_results_0_4.csv".
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/print_graphs.py
    - Graph should be printed.

3) Rank experiments:
    - Enter to the main directory.
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/test_rank.sh &
    - Results should be print to terminal.
    - Copy the results and create the csv file "./experiments/results/*.csv".
    - Run: > ./experiments/scripts/print_graphs.py
    - Graph should be printed.

*) Note:
Before running the experiments with time, it is recommanded to disable the log writes.
Doing this by changing "def print_info(msg)" in utils, to "return None" in the beginning
of the function (instead of writing to log and stdout a lot of messages).
