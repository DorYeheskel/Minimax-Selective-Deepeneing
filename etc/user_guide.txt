How to see your game ?
After the game finished, in ./tmp/game.pgn there will be a record of the game.

If you install pyperclip lib successfully (using pip install of the requirements file),
in the end of the game, this will copied automatic the entire file to your clipboard.

When using: --open_lichess, it will open the lichess website with an empty box,
and all you need to do is "ctrl + v".
(or, if the automatic clipboard failed, copy the data of the PGN file to that box)

This is the web: https://lichess.org/paste
